					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../index.html#comment-1218&quot;&gt;Abdurehim&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Abdurehim,

Push notifications have been implemented since January 2017, but unfortunately the GitLab server team is ignoring my requirements to have them work.

As of today is still a no go, as they say there isn’t enough interest from people in order to develop this integration.

You can register your interest here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29488

Apologies, that doesn&#039;t help your case.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello. 
I&#039;ve been using Gitlab Control iOS App for some time now, and I&#039;m planning to upgrade. I want to know one thing though: in the full version, can I get notifications when someone in my team send a commit on the projects I&#039;m participated in? I really need this feature and that&#039;s why I want to try the pro version in the first place. 
Thanks.]]></description>
